## Change by Design

###### The new logo, designed by Naim Heerah:

Our task was to refresh a brand and give it a new direction, and we where given Guide Dogs UK as part of the brief.

### Research (Guide Dogs UK)

To start with, we needed to decide how we were going to redirect the brand of Guide Dogs UK. After exploring their existing branding online such as their website and social medias, I found that the initial branding of Guide Dogs UK left a lot to be desired. The first one being their website, while it was functional in terms of usability for the impaired with scalable text and colour alteration options, the aesthetic was boring and didn’t innovate. From looking at their social medias I gathered that there was no clear target audience. So then it was decided as a team we would target millennials with our new branding. I researched what should be implemented into our branding to meet what we were setting out to do, these are some of the sources I found:

- https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/microsites/guide-dogs-in-school/puppy-resources/how-can-a-guide-dog-change-a-life/how-are-guide-dogs-trained/
- https://www.newscred.com/wp-content/themes/newscred/assets/downloads/guide/NewsCred_Millennial_Mind.pdf
- https://insights.newscred.com/content-drives-millennial-brand-loyalty/
- https://insights.newscred.com/welcome-to-the-performance-era-of-content-marketing/
- http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/07/31/which-brands-do-millennials-best

From the research done, I gathered a good insight into what Guide Dogs UK wanted to achieve as a brand. They want to support those who need guide dogs, but they also want to educate people about exactly what a guide dog does and why they’re an important cause to support. In addition I looked into research done on branding and marketing towards millennials. I found that in terms of a social media strategy, the content we share should be educational and short, and the best way to do that would be through infographics. And so we did produce an example infographic for the brand that aligned with this and the fact that our content needs to be compelling for it to meet its purpose.

### Guide Dogs UK new brand guidelines

To establish a set of guidelines for the brand, I had to examine how to express that as an item by looking at how other brands write and present theirs. From looking at them I knew what I needed to include in ours, such as the language we use and what fonts we use and in what context. Being a charity trying to help people, I established the guidelines language as something approachable, giving, and inspiring because I felt that was what was most relevant to the brands new direction we were giving it. The colour scheme was also redesigned to better fit our new modern aesthetic with lighter shades and colours that better complimented one and other. The colours used, like blue, help us express ourselves as something kind and open just by our appearance.

## Content Strategy
_Note: at one point my project was called **"Big Bear is Watching"** and now it's called **"A Day in the Future"**_


## User Feedback 
[These are the notes I made as my test users where using and commenting on the site!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f3Cg6D7tGP0C0DIN9Zxg5i3EvK1-9z597vsQjk9vy3E/edit?usp=sharing)
They mentioned grammar errors that I didn't notice, and some design flaws. The grammar was addressed, and most of the design flaws where too. They noticed that it was awkward when moving from certain parts of the story, because the parallax scrolling would mess around with the perception of the image. To amend this, I added the thin black lines between sections that I mentioned earlier. The only slight issue that could't be fixed was that they thought some parts of the site where buttons when they weren't (the parts I'm talking about are the white boxes at the start and end, with a black background surrounding them). They weren't fixed because it was only minor in their opinion, and I couldn't find an alternative.

## Wireframes
These are the two wireframes I made, and the final site did resemble these for the most part.
